    "This notebook is a follow up on the notebook: Lab3.5.ml.emotion-detection-bow.ipynb and on Lab2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook *Lab3.3.ml.emotion-detection-bow* showed how you can create a bag-of-words vector representation from a text and how to feed it to a machine to learn to assign emotion labels to it. Words from the training set become features in the vector and the machine learns to associate these with the emotion classes. Unseen text is represented in the same way as a bag-of-words vector and through similarity with the training data, the machine makes a prediction on the emotion encoded in the unseen text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to replace the bag-of-words by a word embedding representation of the text. We discussed word-embeddings in Lab2 as a powerful model to represent families of words that are related. Now imagine that we replace our text representations of words by a representation based on embeddings? \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that training data will be boosted to represent families of related words and can be compared to text with  words unseen in the training data but with embeddings that make them similar to words that have been seen. Our hypothesis is that this will improve the recall but maybe at the price of precision. Our evaluation will show if this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using embeddings to replace word tokens in data, is a powerful method to make training data more robust. Whereas the vectors for tokens in a bag-of-words are large and sparse (thousands of dimensions and many zero values), the embeddings representaions are small and dense (300 dimensions or less and all dimensions have some positive or negative value). The dense vectors loose details but form powerful generalisations. Can you image that you represent the meaning of a text using 300 digits?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test this hypothesis in this notebook by creating vectors based on *averaged* word vectors for the same MELD data and testing it in the same way as we did before on MELD data and our own set of utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big challenge to do this: how to represent a whole text or document through wordembeddings? We cannot simply replace words in a bag-of-words vector by embeddings. Think about this. What would it mean to compare one text to another? Work out a simple example to try this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to use a very crude and simple solution below. We average the embeddings of the words of a document to represent the document. Other options are to sum, to concatenate, multiply, each with problems for comparing documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec was proposed as an alternative but this requires building new embedding models from data.\n",

    "\n",
    "A recent alternative way to create a 'semantic' representation of a word is by word embeddings: mapping words (or phrases) from the vocabulary to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with many dimensions per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension. For this reason, they are called dense representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, word embeddings were discussed in the research area of distributional semantics. The idea is to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The underlying notion is that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" (Firth 1957). \n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings do not directly represent these context words but are the learned weights in the hidden layer of a neural network that tries to predict the context words. In that sense, we do not need thousands of dimensions to represent all possible context words but just the learned weights.\n",

This results in large and sparse vector representations for each utterance. We have also seen that we can weight the relevance of a word using the 'TF.IDF' function.
