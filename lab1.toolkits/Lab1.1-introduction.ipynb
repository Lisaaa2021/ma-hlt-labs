    "* **Morphological analysis:** separating words into morphemes and identifying their classes (e.g. tense/aspect of verbs, number, gender)\n",
    "* **Stemming:** identifying a base form of words in context by removing inflectional/derivational affixes, such as 'troubl' for 'troubles/troubling/troubled'\n",
    "* **Lemmatization:** identifying the lemmas (dictionary forms) of words in context, such as 'trouble' for 'troubles/troubling/troubled'\n",
    "* **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** assigning the correct meaning to words in context, 'bank' as river side or financial institute\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** identifying phrases that name people, locations, organizations, etc. in text\n",
    "* **Constituency/dependency parsing:** analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence: *noun and verb phrases*, syntactic relations such as *subject* or *object* with predicates\n",
    "* **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** analyzing the semantic structure of a sentence (*who* does *what* to *whom*, *where* and *when*)\n",

    "* **Topic modeling:** determining the topic of text: *sports*, *politics*, *disaster*, *weather*, etc.\n",
    "* **Word Vectors (or Word Embeddings) and Semantic Similarity:** representing the meaning of words as vectors (rows of real valued numbers) where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors (very popular these days and explained later in this course)"

    "It is important to realize that it is common practice to install python packages in different virtual environments. You can define as many environments as you want and some installations, like Anaconda, create their own. The environments listed in the Navigator image shown above are environments within the Anaconda installation that available on my machine. In my Anaconda Navigator, you see some exotic names such as *cltl-chat-ui* and *leolani* which are environments created by me. The list on your machine will be different. You can find instructions and more information about creating, activating and stopping virtual environments here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why do you need to know about this now?*\n",
    "As a beginner, it is not likelyy that you create environments right away. However when you install more and more of these fantastic NLP packages and modules that people created and shared with the world, your machine gets cluttered with *stuff*. You may get conflicts because packges depend on other packages but have version conflicts or packages get installed in different environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next image for example shows two terminals on my machine. One opened from Anaconda and the other smaller window opened from the Terminal application on my mac. The command *pip list* shows all the packages installed with the *pip-installer*. From the screen dumps you can see that both terminals list different packages:\n",

    "If you do not know in which environment you are working, you might be suprised that your code cannot find or import something although you are sure you installed it. For example, you can see in ethe above image that the package \"blinker\" is installed in the standard basic Terminal of my Mac but not in the Anaconda terminal. The next screen dump show what happens if we start Python in both terminals and try to import the module. Even though both terminals tell you that the same Python is running (3.7.6), the module *blinker* can only be important in the standard Terminal and not within Anaconda:\n",

    "It is therefore important to realize how you opened a terminal to install packages. Try to do that in a consistent way, especially when starting, so that you do not run into installation and import problems. When you are more skilled, you should start defining virtual environments yourself that you activate at will and install all you need and nothing else within that environment."
